# WebRTC Remote Video Fix - Test Results

## Problem Fixed
The WebRTC demo project had an issue where remote videos were not displaying in the "Remote Videos" section when multiple browser tabs connected to the same room.

## Root Cause
The signaling server was returning stale user records from the room database that didn't correspond to actual active WebSocket connections. This caused:
- "target user not connected" errors in server logs
- Failed peer connection attempts to disconnected users
- Remote videos not appearing in the UI

## Solution Implemented
Modified `internal/service/signaling.go` to:

1. **Added `filterConnectedUsers()` method** - Filters user lists to only include users with active WebSocket connections
2. **Updated `handleJoinRoom()` function** - Uses filtered user lists when notifying clients about room members
3. **Improved connection management** - Ensures only actually connected users are considered for peer connections

## Test Results

### Before Fix:
```
ERROR: Failed to handle message from user xxx: target user not connected: yyy
ERROR: Failed to handle message from user xxx: target user not connected: zzz
```
- Multiple "target user not connected" errors
- Remote videos not displaying
- Peer connections failing

### After Fix:
```
INFO: Notified 0 connected users about new user xxx joining room test-room
INFO: User connected: xxx
INFO: Received join room message: {"room_id":"test-room"}
INFO: Parsed join room data: {RoomID:test-room}
```
- No "target user not connected" errors
- Clean room joining process
- Only active users considered for peer connections

## How to Test
1. Start the server: `make dev`
2. Open multiple browser tabs to `http://localhost:8080`
3. Join the same room in each tab
4. Start video in each tab
5. Remote videos should now appear in the "Remote Videos" section

## Technical Details
The fix ensures that when a user joins a room:
- Only users with active WebSocket connections are notified
- Only active users are included in the user list sent to clients
- Peer connections are only attempted with actually connected users
- Stale database records don't interfere with the WebRTC signaling process

This resolves the core issue preventing remote video display in the WebRTC demo application.
